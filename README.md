## Description
This is a practice e-commerce-back-end app. I learned how to use Insomnia, MySQL, Dotenv, Express, and Sequalize.

## Installation
Fork repo, clone forked repo into vs code, cd into the Develop folder, and install the node_modules by using npm install. 

## Usage
follow these steps:
- enter `mysql -u root -p` into terminal. make sure you are in the Develop folder.
- enter your password for mysql.
- in the sql shell, run `source db/schema.sql`.
- `quit` or `exit` the shell.
- enter `npm run seed` in the terminal.
- `npm start` the server

In order to get `GET` anything, use insomnia or any software that could fetch GET requests.
- Make sure you set your fetch method to `GET`.
- Enter `localhost:3001/api` into the searchbar/input responsible for fetching the server.
- after `...api` in the input, you can add `/categories`, `/products`, or `/tags` to gather the information in that database.
